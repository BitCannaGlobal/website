                It's with a heavy heart that we announce the end of BitCanna's project. We want to explain why we made this difficult decision.
              <br><br>
                In 2018, we set out to solve payment problems for businesses in the legal cannabis industry using blockchain technology. We envisioned a unique solution that would make transactions easier and more efficient. However, as the industry evolved, we realized that our initial idea wasn't as relevant as we thought.
              <br><br>                
                When we moved to a new Cosmos-SDK blockchain in 2021, we were excited to build a foundation for our payment solutions. But as we engaged with companies in the cannabis industry, we found that they no longer needed our help with payments. New EU legislation also added significant complexity to our operations, requiring us to work closely with all entities that accept our token as a payment method, to prevent money laundering and other illicit activities.
              <br><br>                
                We've struggled to find a new direction for our project, which is closely tied to the cannabis industry. We've tried to adapt and change, but ultimately, we came to realize that our original goal wasn't aligned with the changing needs of our target market.
              <br><br>                
                As we bring our project to a close, we're handing over the blockchain and NFT collection to the community. <u><strong>All BCNA tokens that belong to the team's wallets, will be burned in the second week of January, 2025</strong></u>
              <br><br>                
                You'll still be able to make transactions, trade the token, or buy a Buddhead NFT. Our wallets and explorer will remain online till the end of 2025.
              <br><br>                
                We want to thank each and every one of you who has been part of our journey over the past years. Your support means a lot to us, and we're grateful for the opportunity to have had you along.
              <br><br>                
                If you have any urgent matters, you can contact us at support@bitcanna.io.
